# About this book

## Audience

This book is for staff at the Institute of Neuroscience and Psychology / School of Psychology at the University of Glasgow. Any opinions expressed herein do not reflect those of the Institute or School, or the University of Glasgow.

## How it works

1. Figure out how to do something that you probably figured out many times before and forgot. (I take a generous view of what it means to "figure something out": if you ask someone and they tell you, that counts.)

2. Get annoyed at how difficult it was to figure out how to do the thing that you probably once knew and then forgot.

3. Wish that you had a reliable way to keep track of such things.

3. Stew in your annoyance at hard-to-learn-easy-to-forget trivial sh*t until your brain reminds you of this resource.

4. Fork and clone [the repository](https://github.com/dalejbarr/annoying-sh-t) if you haven't already. If you have, pull to update your copy.

5. Find the RMarkdown file for your topic or create one if it doesn't exist. Add your entry, and put your name and the date below it in italics.

6. Commit your changes, push to your fork, and then submit a pull request. Once the pull request is accepted, the book will be re-rendered and the website will be updated.

7. Remind yourself that this resource is called `annoying-sh-t` so you'll be more likely to remember it the next time you encounter annoying sh*t.

8. Bask in the momentary glory of knowing that you've saved others and your future self time and headaches.
